# Revealing unseen dynamical regimes of ecosystems from population time-series data

This repository contains the code and data associated with the [bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.07.607005v1): Medeiros, L. P., Sorenson, D. K., Johnson, B. J., Palkovacs, E. P., and Munch, S. B. (2024). Revealing unseen dynamical regimes of ecosystems from population time-series data.

In this study, we introduce an approach that integrates population time-series data and information on an environmental driver into a Gaussian Process regression model with time-delay embedding (GP-EDM) to predict previously unseen dynamical regimes of ecosystems.

The repository contains 4 folders: *code*, *data*, *figs*, and *tables*. Under *code/scripts* we provide the R scripts to reproduce Figures 1-5 and SI figures. Empirical data sets are located under *data/microbial_experiment* and *data/lake_plankton*. All figures and tables from our study can be found under *figs* and *tables*.
